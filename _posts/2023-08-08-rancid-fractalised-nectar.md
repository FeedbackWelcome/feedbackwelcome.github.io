All hail the Error Instruments Tele Blender and Xaoc Devises Sofia on this lazy Saturday winter morning.

## PATCH NOTES

Driver = ALM PAMs New - 2x channels used for triggers, 4x LFOs, 2x random 100% PW; like S&H.
Percussion Brains = Beast-Tek Amoeba With infrequent density controlled by a slowish LFO and evolve trigger from AND logic of random out and a very slow LFO, Pathogen & Mutagen.

1v/oct to all percussion elements, each detuned = Make Noise 0-CTRL - clocked by Pathogen's 1st gate, sends clock out to MN Wogglebug, received direction and reset triggers from Mutagen probability logic taken from 4th Amoeba output, also sends the odd gate elsewhere inc a reset to Amoeba.
Percussion voices = Error Instruments Liquid Glitcher, Spanky and Soundscaper; Solid State Fate Ultra-Kick, all straight out, no effects.

Ochd is synced by ear and is a little out - predominantly slow LFOs out to various places.

MN Tape & Microsound Machine = beautiful fine crackles, pops and clicks from Morphagene, only 1 shortish sample; only morph and varispeed under CV; mangled in QPAS then sometimes destroyed by Mimeophon, pushed out to gorgeous repeating feedback throb on occasion - Wogglebug and Maths controlling.

Leads brain = Stochastic Inspiration SIG+ in free running mode & Error Instruments Tele Blender receiving a random held voltage to control algorithm.

Lead 1 = Sofia -SIGch1, Tele Blender CV out controlling Sofia's Warp B -} Error Instruments White Rabbit controlled by Tele Blender's 2nd CV -on delay+error. I bought this primarily for reverb, but the error delay is just too juicy to move away from.

Lead 2 = Error Instruments Drone Bank, all 4 oscillators slightly detuned -SIGch2 -} Soma Lyra-8 FX -} Joranalogue Enhance2 - this is all that's running for the tail few mins of the video.
Lead 3 = Tele Blender -SIGch1 -} 2hp Verb w/ mix controlled by an LFO for a nice throb.

## Other modules in play

After Later Audio QARV -just for 2 triggered plucky percussion envelopes
Xaoc Devises Warna II
Frap Tools 333
Behringer 1036 -dual S&H, Four LFO and Four Play. Sorry Intellijel, it's a lot to fork out for a handful of your quad VCAs - I do try to at least have something from an og maker if I get a Behringer knockoff, e.g., I have the Planar2 though not used in this patch.
ALA SHTH -the synced constant random voltages from S&H/T&H modules are predominantly used for percussion voice sound sculpting and panning in the mixer.
Expert Sleepers ES-9 receiving midi to control volume and panning
Tesseract Sweet Sixteen - sending midi to ES-9

## VISUALS

Concurrent recordings: Old phone camera recording video. ProjectM, randomised - I still need to curate 90% of the presets, but I managed to capture a few okay ones here; w/ effect overlays, responding to the the mic input and recorded in OBS.
Rudimentary post editing: Davinci Resolve

## STORY

This impromptu patch evolved out of testing new Amoeba and Pathogen modules and the new midi cable I knocked up for controlling the ES-9 in standalone mode with Sweet Sixteen. While Amoeba worked for this patch, I still have very little idea how to use it the way I want to.. And while it's nice to control the ES-9 w/ faders, cv to midi via s16 to ES-9 was a no at high speed.

I had planned to try to play/perform this patch a little for the video recording, but I really like the generative aspects just the way they are. I 've happily listened to this patch without barely touching anything for many hours.. After all that listening, now the only thing I can think of noodling with are SIG+ and Amoeba..

No post/mastering work has been done on the audio -no eq, compression, sidechaining, post effects etc; recorded directly into the PC motherboard's mic input jack with Audacity. Using the ES-9 mixer in reverse of original design intention controlled by Sweet Sixteen -the pc's doing enough with the visuals without throwing 13 channel DAW recording with digital effects processing into the mix; and I can't help myself but add a bit of EQ, ducking and reverb at the least on most channels when mucking around in a DAW. The only changes made throughout the recording was on the Sweet Sixteen output levels, and around 11:30ish I throw the Ultra-Kick's duck channel into the level control jack for lead voices 1+3 for a couple mins to allow the kick to shine and give it that classic pulse. Percussion envelopes go in the Sweet Sixteen level jacks and synced random voltages for percussion pan jacks.

This patch is a very inefficient use of modules/spaghetti. As I'm patching I think "I need this" and go and find something that's free, and move on, rather than sitting back and thinking out how to achieve the same functionality using 1 module and cable to perform several tasks in a cohesive and efficient way.

Also, I failed to set the framerate when starting the video project, so frames get lost and we lose some of the blinky-blinks.
